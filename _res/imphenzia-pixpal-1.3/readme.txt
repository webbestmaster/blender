*** REFLECTIVE SURFACES (METAL & MIRROR) **************************************

The materials in the Blender file, the Unity project, the Unreal Engine
project and the Godot project have the correct texture settings, material and
shaders for texture quality, emission, to work.

Note that Unity URP and Godot do not support reflection as good as Blender and
Unreal Engine.


*** VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ************************************************

If you create your own materials, take the following into consideration:

!! USE NEAREST NEIGHBOR / CLOSEST / POINT FILTERING !!

If you use the textures in a game engine, make sure you set the filtering to
Nearest Neighbor or Closest (it should NOT be bilinear or bicubic - it smears
the textures since the colors are only one pixel in width).

!! DO NOT USE TEXTURE COMPRESSION !!

If you use compression on the textures in a game engine, the colors will be
incorrect. Disable any form of compression on the texture - it needs to be
pixel perfect.

!! DO NOT USE MIPMAPS !!

The pixel perfect textures are already as small as they can be so it is
advised to disable mipmapping, especially in Unreal Engine where Nanite
can create artifacts around edges of low poly objects.

!! USE WRAP / REPEAT - NOT CLAMP !!

Animations rely on UVs wrapping or repeating at the edges, otherwise the
animated colors will stop as time goes beyond one second. 


*** VERSION HISTORY ***********************************************************

You are welcome to port the Imphenzia PixPal palette textures, materials, and
shaders to any game engine or software. 

!! You may also include some or all showcase sample assets in such ports but
you must then also include this readme.txt file !!
